# Cycle.js starter template

This is a simple starter template for [Cycle.js](http://cycle.js.org/) apps.


## Installing

From the command line after cloning:

`npm install`
`npm run start`

### Development

You can start a local server at `http://localhost:8000` for your application with `npm run start`. It uses [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) and provides hot reloading out of the box.


### Production

Not configured for production build. May need a separate webpack.config for that.
